/*!
 * \brief Initializes everything this mod needs, creating its own window
 *
 * Idea: Replace the Display class too, maybe?
 *
 * This class is kinda a facade and kinda a God class that holds all the everything that the mod needs. I'd like it to
 * be more of a facade but idk. Facades are hard.
 *
 * This class's instance runs completely in a separate thread. Whatever you want to use it for, it runs in a separate
 * thread. Calling froman application with a million threads already? Too bad, separate thread.
 *
 * I'm not worried about data races. Data moves into this thread, then gets rendered. The only data racey thing are the
 * flags that specify rendering commands are available. However, I'm using atomics for those, so I don't expect too many
 * problems. If I notice the renderer missing render commands, I'll re-evaluate the data integrity scheme
